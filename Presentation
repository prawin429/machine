1. UNCOMTRADE: I have written a Python code which Extracts Trade data and Major 5 Countries.
Data can be extracted for single HS code, (Segment wise) 2 and 4 HS codes. This can be done in very short span of time (1- 5 Mins) but same work is done manually in more than 4 hours. 
Generally, feasibility study for trade data for all countries consumes more time but by using this code work done in 3 hours.
In order to get major 5 countries everyone is using VLOOKUP and Pivot Table which is little confusing and takes more time in case of many HS codes. 
To extract major 5 countries data for one HS code manually, we will take 5 minutes where as I can extract major 5 countries data along with conversations (US$ Million, Th Metric Tons) for 4 HS codes in 5 minutes. 
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken. 
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Cons: -
1.	8-digit Hs code data not available for free version API.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
2.Eurostat: I have written a Python code which Extracts Demand Value, Volume, Imports and Exports for all countries in short span of time. 
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
3.NSF (National Science Foundation): I have written a Python code which extracts University studies along with details like Title, Funding Amount, Project Start date and Funding Source in short span of time.
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
4. Lenâ€™s. Org: I have written a Python code which extracts University studies along with details like Title, Abstract and Funding Source for all countries in short span of time.
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Cons: -
1.	Paid ID only. 
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
5. USDA: I have written a Python code which Extracts Production Volume, Imports and Exports for all countries in short span of time. 
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
6. USDA PubAg: I have written a Python code which Extracts University studies along with details like Title and Abstract for all countries in short span of time. 
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests
7. Europe PubMed Central: I have written a Python code which extracts University studies along with details like Title, Abstract and Start Date for all countries in short span of time.
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requests

8. Science Direct: I have written a Python code which extracts University studies along with details like Title, DOI for all countries in short span of time.
If we want to find university studies manually through science direct, we have to open every link and search whether that university study belong to our county or not.
Pros: -
1.	Less time taken.
2.	Re use code.
3.	Complete Automation.
Used Python Libraries: Python NumPy, Pandas, JSON, Requestss
9. Googles schooler: Currently working on it.
10. Office for National Statistics, Destatis, UN Data: Currently working on it.
